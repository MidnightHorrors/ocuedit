### Running Locally

To run the project locally, you will need to have
[Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.1/getting_started/installation) installed.
You can install Deno in one line using the following command:

```
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

Once Deno is installed, you can run the project using the following command:

```
deno task start
```

This will start the project on port 8000. You can access the project at
`localhost:8000`.
